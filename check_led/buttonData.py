# Raspberry Pi Phant Example

#
# This example demonstrates how to post data to a phant server (e.g.
#   data.sparkfun.com) using python on a Raspberry Pi.
#   The RPi.GPIO module is used to enable I/O reading and writing.
#   Before running this script, make sure to update your public and
#   private keys (publicKey and privateKey vars).
#
# Development environment specifics:
#   Raspberry Pi rev2 -- modified for ev3 by William Church
#
# This code is beerware; if you see me (or any other SparkFun employee)
# at the local, and you've found our code helpful, please buy us a round!
# Distributed as-is; no warranty is given.

            # to send the data to data.sparkfun.com/input/PUBLIC_KEY.txt
            # and include both our data (params) and headers
